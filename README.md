# VQ-Eigensolver
VQE Algorithm - Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm. We try to used it to optimise and measure the ground state energy under the specified Hamiltonian and lattice.

Quantum state preparation entails taking a quantum system from one state to another, like taking a system with qubits all set to |0>, and putting it into a known but arbitrary state. This can be far more challenging than merely setting the values of qubits, however. Quantum state preparation is a fundamental element of quantum computation, but it can be very difficult in practice.
